#### 3.4 HotSpot的算法细节实现


##### 3.4.1 根节点枚举

迄今为止，所有收集器在根节点枚举这一步骤时都是必须暂停用户线程的，因此毫无疑问根节点
枚举与之前提及的整理内存碎片一样会面临相似的“Stop The World”的困扰。

所以当用户线程停顿下来之后，其实并不需要一个不漏地检查完所有
执行上下文和全局的引用位置，虚拟机应当是有办法直接得到哪些地方存放着对象引用的。在HotSpot
的解决方案里，是使用一组称为OopM ap的数据结构来达到这个目的

- oopMap 数据结构

一旦类加载动作完成的时候，HotSpot就会把对象内什么偏移量上是什么类型的数据计算出来，在即时编译过程中，也会在特定的位置记录下栈里和寄存器里哪些位置是引用。

Scavenge GC:

Also known as Young Generation or Minor GC.
Primarily focuses on cleaning up short-lived objects in the young generation (often called Eden space) of the heap.
It is designed to quickly identify and collect objects that are no longer reachable.
Generally, the scavenge GC algorithm is fast and efficient, as it only targets a small portion of the heap and collects a significant number of objects at once.
The scavenge GC algorithm uses a copying mechanism, where live objects are moved to a separate survivor space (from Eden to Survivor) before being promoted to the older generation.
The scavenge GC algorithm works based on the assumption that most objects have a short lifespan.
Full GC:

Also known as Tenured Generation or Major GC.
Focuses on cleaning up long-lived objects that have survived multiple Scavenge GC cycles and have been promoted to the older generation of the heap.
The Full GC algorithm covers the entire heap, including both young and old generations.
Full GC tends to take longer compared to scavenge GC, as it performs more comprehensive and complex memory management tasks.
Full GC involves multiple steps, such as identifying and collecting unreachable objects, compacting the heap, and reclaiming fragmented memory.
Full GC is triggered when the older generation is almost full or when a specific threshold is crossed.
In summary, Scavenge GC is optimized for handling short-lived objects in the young generation, while Full GC is responsible for managing long-lived objects in the entire heap, including the older generation. The choice between these algorithms depends on the specific memory characteristics and requirements of the application.
